## Code Review in github ##
 - Github doesn't provide review flag / select eviewer(?) compared with bugzilla
	 - Gerrit could be an option. 
	 - Review board seems the other option
 - Can we attach different file format in github when reports a issue?
	 - May use markdown syntax(?)
 - Can we have review history using github? 
 - Gerrit helps to improve code review flow, but it's not necessary to have gerrit in the first phase.  
	 - Can try it for free in http://gerrithub.io/
	 - We can also host it in AWS. 

## Define Bugzilla element ##

 - Define product, I guess we should have following products
	 - Smart phone / feature phone
	 - TV / STB
 - Can't use Ni ?
 - Customize flag we need 
 - We need to have autolander if we chose github and bugzilla.
 - Need bugzilla APIs   
 - Define component
	 - Except components for Firefox OS, there are still a lot of components in core/..... owned by platform team(?)
